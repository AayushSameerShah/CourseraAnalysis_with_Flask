# CourseraAnalysis_with_Flask
This repository contains my EDA on the coursera certification data scrapped from the web.

# To view this site:
* You should have `WORDCLOUD` library installed
* Other like - Padnas, Matplotlib, Numpy and Flask

**Run** `Simply go → Webpage → controller.py`
That file will run the script and start the webpage in localhost. And to use the other functionality, please install the required packages as stated above.
